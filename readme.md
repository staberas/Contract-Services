#A 'Binding' Smart Contract

This is a 'binding' smart contract. In this case anything written and executed in the contract lives forever in the blockchain (will not self desctuct at the completion). Its main function is to describe :

1. Rules of the transaction (Will there be an advance payment? Does the professional keep some rights from his creation? ect)
2. What is the commision (website creation,logo creation ect) & what it is required to complete the rest of the funds to the proffesional.

What the contract currnetly do :

*It only accepts input from 2 only sources the user and the proffesional (Access control).
*It returns funds if invalid input is accepted.
*You can cancel the contract if you have second thoughts.
